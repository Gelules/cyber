If http(s) ports are open:

1.gobuster
    While on the terminal, I call gobuster to maybe find interesting files and directories.
    gobuster dir -u TARGET -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/{common,big}.txt

2.firefox
    As stupid as it is, opening the site could lead us to an heuristic technic to find a vulnerability.
    Plus, Firefox will be use with BurpSuite.

3.burpsuite
    To begin with, I simply scan the target site with BurpSuite, and filter what I see on the Site map tab.
