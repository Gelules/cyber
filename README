This is a repository with my configuration files and scripts to help me prepare and pass the OSCP.

The install script uses stow to make symlinks from the repository to the root's home.

Be aware that:
    The root login is hard written in some files, you should use them with the user root.
    I use an azerty keyboard for this configuration.
