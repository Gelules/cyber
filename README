This is a repository with my configuration files and scripts to help me prepare and pass the OSCP.

The install script uses stow to make symlinks from the repository to the root's home.

Be aware that:
    The root login is hard written in some files, you should use them with the user root.
    I use an azerty keyboard for this configuration.

Directories used in `install.sh' are for installation only and are not design to pentest.

rountines/:
    It contains files of what I usually do depending of what I am facing of. The filenames speak for themselves.

nmap/:
    - search_target.sh: Use it to scan a whole network and find your target.
    - ports_enumeration: Scan a target to list ports.
